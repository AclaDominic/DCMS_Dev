echo "‚Ä¢ Contextual help sections with step-by-step resolution guides\n";
echo "‚Ä¢ Additional navigation buttons (Return to Dashboard, View Appointments)\n";
echo "‚Ä¢ Improved visual hierarchy and readability\n\n";

echo "=== Key Improvements ===\n\n";
echo "1. **Clear Block Type Identification**: Users immediately know if it's an IP or account issue\n";
echo "2. **Specific Resolution Steps**: Different guidance for IP vs account blocks\n";
echo "3. **Visual Distinctions**: Different colors and icons for different block types\n";
echo "4. **Better UX**: More helpful and actionable messaging\n";
echo "5. **Reduced Confusion**: Clear instructions on what to do next\n\n";

echo "=== Testing Instructions ===\n\n";
echo "To test the improved system:\n";
echo "1. Create a patient with different block types in the admin panel\n";
echo "2. Try to book an appointment as that patient\n";
echo "3. Observe the different messages and UI elements\n";
echo "4. Test IP blocks by blocking specific IP addresses\n";
echo "5. Test account blocks by blocking patient accounts\n\n";

echo "The system now provides much clearer guidance to patients about why they're blocked and how to resolve it!\n";
